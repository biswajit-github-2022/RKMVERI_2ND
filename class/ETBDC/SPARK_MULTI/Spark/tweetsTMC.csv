"Smt. @MamataOfficial led Janasabhas in Jangipur and Murshidabad to support our MP candidates.The Bangla-birodhis, who have provided NO MGNREGA & Awas funds, deserve NO vote from Bengal.Support Joraphool, which provides free-of-cost ration & reject Kamal, which is busy giving free-of-cost speeches!"
"In Surat, Gujarat, the uncontested victory of the BJP candidate in the Lok Sabha election epitomises the anarchy in the Double Engine model of governance.Where is the media now? Their deafening silence speaks volumes while democracy is being ruthlessly murdered in broad daylight, with the fundamental right to vote shamelessly trampled upon."
The zamindars of @BJP4India have always tried to block the funds of Bengal in order to deprive the people of their rightful dues. We have always stood firm in the face of their conspiracies and ensured the well-being of the people of Bengal. https://t.co/PmvMSUpuEa
